# 🧠 DataForge — Curate, Build, and Tell Stories with Your Data

## 🚩 Problem This Project Solves

Finding quality datasets, organizing them, and preparing them for model training or visualization is hard — especially for beginners. There’s no single tool that lets users **curate datasets, scrape online data, store it with proper metadata**, and **build ML models** or **tell visual stories** all in one place.

**DataForge** solves that.

It gives developers, data scientists, and hobbyists a simple platform to manage, visualize, and experiment with their own data.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+** – Main language used for backend logic, scraping, and ML workflows.  
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL** – Database engine for storing datasets and metadata.  
- **FastAPI** – For creating a RESTful API backend.  
- **Typer** – For building the CLI interface.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **BeautifulSoup / Requests / Playwright** – Web scraping utilities.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** – Data visualization.  
- **scikit-learn** – For building and training ML models.  
- **Docker** – To package and deploy the app in a containerized environment.  
- **GitHub Actions (Optional)** – For CI/CD and auto-testing.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- 📦 **Not a Hosted Web App** – Currently designed for local usage only. No cloud-based UI (yet).
- 🧪 **ML Tools are Basic** – Focus is on learning and prototyping, not production-grade modeling.
- 💾 **No Built-in Dataset Hosting** – You must import and manage your own datasets locally.
- 🧰 **Manual Scraping Setup** – Scraping modules work, but may require minor config tweaks depending on the site.
- 👤 **Profile System Not Implemented Yet** – Multi-user support and auth will come in a future version.

## 🧠 Thought Process Behind the Build

The idea came from a common frustration among beginner data scientists and engineers:

> “I want to practice with real data, but I don’t know where to start — and managing datasets is chaos.”

This project was designed to solve **5 core problems**:

1. 🔍 **Finding good datasets is a pain.**  
   → Solution: Curate and tag your own dataset library with context and metadata.

2. 🛠 **Scraping feels like hacking every time.**  
   → Solution: Build modular, beginner-friendly scraping utilities that can extract common data formats.

3. 📊 **No easy way to visualize or test data quickly.**  
   → Solution: Integrate basic visualizations and profiling tools with minimal input required.

4. 🤖 **Model building usually feels separate.**  
   → Solution: Allow for dataset → model workflows directly in one place using scikit-learn.

5. 🧱 **Too many tools, not enough structure.**  
   → Solution: Create a clean Python project with a CLI, optional API, and modular design patterns.

This project is not just a tool — it’s a **launchpad** for learning how to build real-world data pipelines and apps.

> If you can build this, you can build **anything** in data.
