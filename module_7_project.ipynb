        "# Mini Project: Perform Multiple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This project focuses on using multiple linear regression to analyze the relationship between sales and various marketing promotion strategies. By leveraging multiple independent variables, such as TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions, we aim to build a predictive model that estimates sales based on these factors. This project will cover the complete data science pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "Develop a multiple linear regression model to predict sales based on marketing promotion data. The project will involve exploring the dataset, selecting relevant independent variables, fitting the model, checking assumptions, and interpreting the results to provide actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Outcomes\n",
        "1. Understand the concept of multiple linear regression and its applications.\n",
        "2. Learn to preprocess and explore data for regression analysis.\n",
        "3. Gain experience in fitting and evaluating a multiple linear regression model.\n",
        "4. Check and validate regression assumptions.\n",
        "5. Interpret model coefficients and communicate results to stakeholders.\n",
