    "### ❓ What is the Problem?\n",
    "1. A trained fraud detection model exists, but it only runs in isolated, offline environments (e.g., Jupyter notebooks).\n",
    "2. There's no real-time mechanism to serve predictions to the transaction processing system.\n",
    "3. Fraudulent transactions may go undetected or be flagged too late due to a lack of live inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🤔 Why Does the Problem Exist?\n",
    "1. The current model is not productionized — it’s not served through an API.\n",
    "2. There’s no real-time stream processor to handle incoming transactions and feed them to the model.\n",
    "3. The architecture lacks containerization, making deployment across environments inconsistent.\n",
    "4. There’s no system for batch or streaming predictions — only manual, static inputs.\n",
    "5. Business teams don’t have actionable fraud data in real time, limiting their response speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 👥 Who Has This Problem?\n",
    "- **Fintech companies** processing thousands of transactions per minute  \n",
    "- **Data science teams** who can build models but lack deployment expertise  \n",
    "- **Security and compliance teams** needing rapid fraud insights  \n",
    "- **Customers** whose transactions may be delayed or misclassified without real-time detection  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 What?\n",
    "Deploy the trained fraud detection model as a **FastAPI REST API**, containerize it with **Docker**, and stream real-time transaction data using **Kafka** to serve predictions live.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 Why?\n",
    "- REST APIs allow easy integration into live systems via HTTP.  \n",
    "- Kafka enables ingestion and processing of **real-time data** with low latency.  \n",
    "- Docker ensures the service is **portable, scalable, and reproducible** across environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚙️ How?\n",
    "1. Serve the model using **FastAPI** with a `/predict` endpoint.\n",
    "2. Use **Kafka Producer** to stream transaction data.\n",
    "3. Connect a **Kafka Consumer** that feeds data to the API and logs or acts on the prediction.\n",
    "4. Containerize the entire setup using **Docker** for local and cloud deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌍 Vision\n",
    "To create a scalable and production-ready system that empowers fintech platforms to detect and act on fraudulent activity **in real time**, reducing financial risk and increasing customer trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💥 The Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 What?\n",
    "- Real-time fraud predictions integrated into transaction pipelines  \n",
    "- Automated detection process reduces manual review effort  \n",
    "- Modular, reusable infrastructure for future ML models  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📈 Why?\n",
    "- Faster detection → faster reaction → less financial exposure  \n",
    "- Consistency across environments through containerization  \n",
    "- Clear path from model development to production deployment  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 How?\n",
    "- Leverage open-source tools like **FastAPI**, **Kafka**, and **Docker**  \n",
    "- Use streaming architecture to simulate real-world behavior  \n",
    "- Build a system designed to scale as the company grows  \n",

    "### 🚀 Step 3: Creating the REST API with FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Purpose of This Step\n",
    "Now that we’ve trained a model to detect fraud, we need a simple and secure way to **use it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step builds a **REST API** – a type of web service – that receives transaction data and returns whether it's **fraudulent or not**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a digital fraud-checking assistant. You send it a transaction, and it quickly tells you if you should be worried. ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛠️ Tools We Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FastAPI**: A modern Python web framework for building APIs.\n",
    "- **Uvicorn**: A lightweight server to run the API.\n",
    "- **Pydantic**: Ensures input data is clean and well-structured.\n",
    "- **Joblib**: Loads our previously trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 📦 1. Define What the API Accepts (Input Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Pydantic** to define the expected transaction fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transaction includes:\n",
    "- 28 anonymized feature values (`V1` to `V28`)\n",
    "- A timestamp (`Time`)\n",
    "- The amount spent (`Amount`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ⚙️ 2. Build the FastAPI App\n",
    "We create a small web app with:\n",
    "\n",
    "A / root route for health-checks\n",
    "\n",
    "A /predict route to make predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 🧪 3. Test the API (Locally)\n",
    "To run the API locally, we use Uvicorn:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Step Completion Checklist\n",
    "- API initialized with FastAPI\n",
    "- predict route accepts JSON and returns prediction\n",
    "- Trained model successfully loaded into API\n",
    "- API tested locally via Swagger UI"
